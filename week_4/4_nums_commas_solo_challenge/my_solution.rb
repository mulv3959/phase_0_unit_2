# U2.W4: Numbers to Commas Solo Challenge

# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and 
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented in the file.  


# 1. Pseudocode

# What is the input?
# input a integer
# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)
# returns a string with a comma separating every three characters
# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?
# Well first I believe we need to turn it into a string.
# After it is in a string I have to find a pattern that allows me to tell the computer 
# to insert a comma in the correct spot (maybe using the split method?)

# 2. Initial Solution




# 3. Refactored Solution



# 4. Reflection
